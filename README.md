It's a digital resume and portfolio combined, providing a comprehensive view of a person's professional capabilities. Portfolio websites are particularly popular among creative professionals, such as designers, artists, photographers, writers, and developers, but they can be useful for anyone looking to highlight their professional accomplishments.
